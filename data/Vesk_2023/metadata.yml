  description: To collect a trait dataset on southern Australian eucalypt trees to
    support study of the correlations among traits and to support statistical modelling
    of trait-environment relationships.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: life_stage
  sampling_strategy: We sought to maximise coverage across taxa of eucalypts in our
    study regions. These were collected predominantly around the southern Great Dividing
    Range in south-eastern Australia, but also included smaller collections in the
    Gariwerd Grampians, Millewa Mallee region, and Koi Kyenunu-ruff Stirling National
    Park in Western Australia. We chose locations to maximise cross-species coverge
    within our study regions. We aimed to collect from at least 3 individuals in (Stirling
    Range, WA) and at least 5 individuals elsewhere. We attempted to sample leaf traits,
    stem traits, fruit and seed traits on the same individuals, but this was not always
    possible owing to access to the canopy on tall individuals. We sampled mostly
    mature individuals, but covered a range of sizes including saplings.
  original_file: The continuous trait dataset was prepared and is contained within
    the R package eucdata (Windecker et al. 2021).
  notes: All trait data in this dataset were collected and processed anew by this
    project.

traits:
- var_in: fruit_wall_width_mm
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: fruit_wall_thickness
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Minimum thickness (mm) of outer layer of oven-dried fruit below valves.
- var_in: height_m
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  entity_type: population
  value_type: maximum
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: replicates
  methods: Height (m) of individual trees was first measured via clinometer along
    with girth at breast height. The sampling strategy for this study was generally
    not to target the largest individuals, but to get a range of sizes, and usually
    (but not always) these trees sampled were those with material within reach of
    pole clippers. So it will tend to have smaller individuals as well and the values
    documented here are simply the maximum individual height recorded at a location.
    The high values for plant height are also expected, are the species list includes
    several of the tallest tree species in the world, including Eucalytus regnans,
    Eucalytus viminalis, and Eucalytus delegatensis.

  unit_in: cm
  trait_name: plant_diameter_breast_height
  entity_type: population
  value_type: maximum
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: replicates
  methods: Diameter was calculated from girth at breast height. The sampling strategy
    for this study was generally not to target the largest individuals, but to get
    a range of sizes, and usually (but not always) these trees sampled were those
    with material within reach of pole clippers. So it will tend to have smaller individuals
    as well and the values documented here are simply the maximum individual diameter

- var_in: leaf_mass_g
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_mass
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3
  methods: We sampled fully expanded leaves, attempting to sample “sun” leaves. Mass
    (g) of a single leaf including petiole after drying at 60-70C for 72hrs. Replicates
    >/= 3.
- var_in: sla_mm2_per_mg
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3
  methods: SLA was measured as Area of fresh leaf (mm2) including petiole divided
    by dry mass (mg) after oven treatment. Replicates >/=3.
- var_in: leaf_area_cm2
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3
  methods: Area of a single fresh leaf including petiole (cm2) measured with leaf
    area meter. Replicates >/= 3 leaves per plant.
- var_in: fruit_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: fruit_dry_mass
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Mass of single fruit found by averaging mass of 5 replicate empty oven-dried
    fruits (mg) weighed simultaneously. Seeds and chaff were dehisced during oven
    drying, and not included in the weight for this trait.
- var_in: seed_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 10
  methods: Average seed mass found by dividing total mass of 10 seeds (mg) weighed
    simultaneously.
- var_in: bark_thickness_mm
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: bark_thickness
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Bark thickness on individual trees was measured in mm using a bark thickness
    gauge 5 times at breast height along with girth. Relative Bark Thickness at 100cm
    girth was calculated according to the allometric equation, RBT = BT*(100/G)0.52
    determined from data across all species.
- var_in: relative_bark_thickness
  unit_in: mm/mm
  trait_name: bark_thickness_index
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Bark thickness on individual trees was measured in mm using a bark thickness
    gauge 5 times at breast height along with girth.

  unit_in: g/ml
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1-2
  methods: Measured as dry mass (g) of an approx. 1cm diam x 10cm long section of
    twig divided by fresh volume (mL) measured using the displacement method. Occasionally
    some young bark may have been retained. Replicates = 1 or 2.
