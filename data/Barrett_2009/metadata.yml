  description: A government report collating information on the ecological attributes
    of 80 fire-sensitive systems in the South Coast region of Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Southern Prospects, the South Coast Strategy for Natural Resource
    Management, identified that the South Coast region has many fire sensitive ecosystems
    occurring on public and private land; that inappropriate fire regimes were a significant
    threatening process impacting on biodiversity; and that more information was required
    to adequately manage and conserve these systems. This project identifies a preliminary
    list of 80 fire sensitive systems and collates information on their ecological
    attributes that will directly assist their management.

  methods: The following component species lists are not comprehensive lists and their
    level of detail varies considerably between systems. The response to fire and
    rate of maturation rates of flora species is documented where known. Selected
    fire sensitive species are highlighted in bold, these include obligate reseeders,
    in particular serotinous species, as well as structural species sensitive to high
    intensity fire, short range endemics and significant fauna. Plants are classified
    as obligate seeders with a canopy (OSC) or soil-stored seed bank (OSS), basal
    resprouters (RS), epicormic resprouters (RS ep) or facultative resprouter / seeders
    (RS / OSC or OSS) or geophytes (GEO). Unpublished data sources were Sarah Barrett,
