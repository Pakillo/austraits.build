  description: We studied the water acquisition strategy and hydraulic and photosynthetic
    properties of Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala D.C.), a large coastal tree species
    that occupies seasonally dry habitats underlain by superficial aquifers.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: plant_size
  sampling_strategy: The two study sites each consisted of a 50 m x 50 m plot within
    which all measurements were taken. The study species, E. gomphocephala, was a
    canopy dominant at both sites, a range of size classes being represented (characterized
    by diameter at breast height (DBH)) by both seedlings (DBH = 0.02-0.05 m) and
    mature trees (DBH = 0.38-1.70 m).

  methods: The leaf water potential (MPa) was determined before dawn (04:30-06:00 local standard time) during February and October in leaves from each individual (n = 4 plants per size class and site) using a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp, Model 3005, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) (Scholander et al. 1964). Leaves from the upper canopy of each size class were collected and stored cool in snap-lock bags prior to measurement.

  methods: In the wet season, midday leaf water potential (12:00-13:00 local standard time) was measured in the same individuals and the soil-to-leaf water potential gradient, ΔΨ, was calculated as the difference between pre-dawn and midday measurements
