  description: X-ray computed tomography (microCT) images were obtained from different
    aged branch xylem to study the number, size and spatial distribution of in situ
    embolized conduits among three dominant tree species growing in a woodland community.
  basis_of_record: field_experiment
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: We performed the experiments early in the austral spring prior
    to the onset of new leaf and stem extension growth to determine the amount of
    residual embolism. Because of the mild winter temperatures, we could be fairly
    confident that most of the observable embolism was drought induced as opposed
    to freeze-thaw embolism formation. All trees were sampled within a 200 m radius
    on an overcast day (8 October 2019). Cut branches were double bagged with wet
    tissue and were transported within 2 h of collection to the laboratory in Hobart.
    Two branches bearing green foliage were selected from two trees of the following
    three dominant species- the angiosperms Eucalyptus pulchella Desf. (Myrtaceae)
    and Acacia mearnsii De Wild. (Fabaceae) and the conifer Callitris rhomboidea R.Br.
    ex Rich. & A.Rich. (Cupressaceae). Leaf water potential measurement via a pressure
    chamber in Hobart confrmed that all branches were well hydrated at the time of
    collection (Supplementary data Table S1). The branches were re-wrapped and stored
    in the dark prior to transporting them the next day to the Australian Synchrotron
    in Melbourne. To avoid open vessel artefacts, all angiosperm branches were at
    least 2 m long as prior testing in three replicate branches each of A. mearnsii
    and E. pulchella revealed a maximum vessel length in terminal branches of 1.40
    m.

    description: We selected an evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland in the Central
      East of Tasmania, Australia as we had prior knowledge that at the site (1) all
      tree species exhibit similar patterns in water status and (2) all species experienced
      water potentials low enough to induce embolism in the xylem (Skelton et  al.,
      2017). This allowed us to exclude the possibility that differences in native
      embolism are a result of different water stress due to some species having access
      to deeper water reservoirs. The average temperature during summer is 17 °C,
      with an occasional daily maximum of 40 °C. Overall, mean temperatures (measured
      at the Swansea weather station <10 km away, Australian Bureau of Meteorology)
      slightly increased over the last 60 years, resulting in only a few mild frost
      days (0 to -2 °C) in recent winters. Over the last 3 years, this site has received
      less than the average annual precipitation (550  mm), leading to drier than
      normal conditions, which is reflected in a negative three monthly averaged Standardized
      Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3) (Vicente-Serrano et  al., 2010).
      The SPEI3 indicates that drought is a common feature of the site and has increased
      in frequency and intensity in the last years.

  methods: The percentage of embolized vessels and the percentage loss of conductance (PLC) are calculated in relation to the control scans (100 % embolized). During May-August 2020, three trees per species were sampled to quantify the branch vulnerability to embolism during rapid dehydration under laboratory conditions. The preceding 6 months had above average rainfall, thus enabling branches to be collected with new growth that had not been subjected to prior water stress. Branches of similar length to those described above were collected, double bagged
    with wet tissue and transported to Hobart. The optical vulnerability technique,
    as described in Brodribb et al. (2016b) and Johnson et al. (2020), was used on
    3-5 mm wide branches to measure the vulnerability to embolism for all species.
    To capture embolism events, we removed the bark and covered the exposed xylem
    in hydrogel (Tensive, Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfeld, NJ, USA). The branches
    were then secured in 3-D printed clamps with a light source and camera (Cavicam,
    Hobart, Tasmania, Australia) (Johnson et al., 2020). The light within the Cavicams
    illuminated the branch during branch dehydration so that the camera could capture
    the branch surface. Pictures were taken every 3 min and stored on an SD card until
    full branch dehydration was achieved. A stem psychrometer (PSY1, ICT International,
    Armidale, NSW, Australia) or periodic water potential measurements with a pressure
    chamber were used to monitor the decline in water potential during the dehydration.
    Images were processed following the guidelines described at www.opensourceov.org
    and Brodribb et  al. (2016a). In short, all images were processed by extracting
    the image difference between subsequent images in ImageJ (version 1.52a, Schneider
    et al., 2012). Image thresholding was used to count the number and size of embolism
    events throughout the dehydration process. The amount of embolized pixel area
    was extracted from each image and expressed as a percentage of total embolized
    pixel area to relate the increase in embolism percentage to time. Following this,
    the linear relationship between water potential and time from the psychrometer
    and pressure chamber readings was used to predict the water potential for each
    embolism event (Fig. 2B). All tree-level vulnerability curves can be viewed in
    Supplementary data Fig. S2. The infection point, P50, was predicted from this
    relationship.

  methods: The percentage of embolized area is calculated as the percentage of embolized area relative to the total sapwood area in all native scans. During May-August 2020, three trees per species were sampled to quantify
    the branch vulnerability to embolism during rapid dehydration under laboratory
    conditions. The preceding 6 months had above average rainfall, thus enabling branches

  methods: All microCT images were analysed in ImageJ version 1.52a by first identifying
    the pixels representing embolized conduits through the Renyi Entropy auto thresholding
    algorithm (Kapur et  al., 1985). Following this, conduits were separated manually
    and by using the watershed algorithm (Sage and Unser, 2001). The xylem area, conduit
    area and number were obtained for each native and control image and used to determine
    the theoretical sapwood area-specifc hydraulic conductance (Ktheo, kg m-1 MPa-1
    s-1) which was calculated as Ktheo = (π x <U+03C1> x Σ d4)/(128 x η x A xylem), where
    d is the conduit diameter (m), η the viscosity of water (1.002 x 10-9 MPa s),
    <U+03C1> the density of water (998.2 kg m-3), both at 20 °C, and A xylem the sapwood
    area without pith (m2). Light microscopy images of the scan positions suggest
    that a small proportion of Eucalyptus vessels were potentially flled with tyloses
    and thus unable to conduct water (Jacobsen et al., 2018). These vessels appeared
    grey, instead of black in the microCT control scan and could therefore be removed
    from the analysis by the automatic thresholding algorithm.

  methods: A reference scan showing 100 % embolism was made by cutting each branch close to the scan positions and rescanning all previously imaged scan positions (control scan), allowing us to estimate the total functional vessel number.
